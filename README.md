# A 3D printable double drawer for cruzher's Small items organizer

It's a remix of **cruzher**'s work so you can have a drawer that's slightly more than twice the height of the current drawers without modifying the shelf. It's useful for small parts that don't fit with the height of a single drawer. =)

If you want to modify it, use the file **Double_Drawer_base.123dx**, this is basically where you can start from to make other type of drawers (_i.e. with more compartments_).

See the [my page at Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2188644) for instructions on how to print it.
